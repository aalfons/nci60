Manufacturer: Affymetrix
Platform: Human Genome U133
Molecular Target: RNA
Platform Description: 44,000 probeset 2-chip set.

Raw data: cel files
Normalization method: GCRMA
Cell lines: NCI-60

Description of Normalization Method: GCRMA

The intensities of the probes in each probeset were combined and normalized using GCRMA (GC-Robust Multi-array Average). 
This was done using the "gcrma" package in R with default options. The GCRMA procedure replicates the RMA 
(Robust Multi-array Average) method with the additional step of estimating cross-hybridization using the GC content of the probe. 
The GCRMA function also does logarithm to base 2, so no further logarithm was taken.
